# TweetMap Project

This project plots tweets on the Google Maps. The drop down lists has different filters which when clicked on, starts live-streaming twitter data for selected tweets. These tweets are stored on Elastic Search with help from EC2. 

Screenshots are added in the 'Screenshots' folder.
